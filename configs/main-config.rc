#
# DATABASE SECTION
#
# Choose the Database Flavor. By the moment, we only support mysql and postgres
#
# dbflavor = mysql | postgres
dbflavor="mysql"
#
# The following variable tell the installer if it should create the databases for
# all openstack services. If "dbcreate" is "yes", you must supply the root user and
# it's password. The installer asumes that no database software is installed, so the
# installer will take care of this task ONLY if the variable "dbinstall" is "yes".
# If you have access to an external database server, dbinstall should be "no".
# dbcreate="yes": All openstack related databases will be created in the selected
# database backend using the supplied user/password access to the server.
# dbinstall="yes": The installer will install the database software. If you use this
# option in "yes", also you MUST use "dbcreate=yes" and "dbpopulate=yes".
dbcreate="yes"
dbinstall="yes"
#
# Access information for MySQL

#
# Access information for PostgreSQL

psqldbport="5432"
#
#
# The following variable indicates the installer to "populate" the openstack
# databases (cinder, glance, keystone, etc.). If this is a new installation, wheter
# you use an external database server or not, you shoud use "yes" here.
# If this a reinstallation, use "no"
#
dbpopulate="yes"
# NOTA: If "dbpopulate" is "no", the "dbcreate/dbinstall" variables are overriden and
# no action is taken for database installation, creation or population.
#
# Here you define the database backend server IP address. You can use an IP or a FQDN:
dbbackendhost="192.168.50.12"

#
# MESSAGE BROKER SECTION
#
# You must install the message broker in the controller or in the controller-compute but
# never in a compute node.
# If this server is a pure controller or a controller-compute, the variable must be "yes",
# else, put "no".
messagebrokerinstall="yes"
# The IP or FQDN of the message broker (always fill this, no matter if you are installing
# a controller or a compute node).
messagebrokerhost="192.168.50.12"
#
# We currently support both rabbitmq and qpid as message brokers. Normally you'll prefer
# our default: RabbitMQ. Change brokerflavor to "qpid" if you want to use qpid, or leave
# it in "rabbitmq" if you prefer to stick to our default.
